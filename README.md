## How It Works

- **Navigation Bar:** Uses Bootstrap for layout and interactive dropdown.
- **Parallax Sections:** CSS background images create depth and motion as users scroll.
- **Forms:** Utilizes Bootstrap forms for search, destination personalization, and contact.
- **Cards & Carousel:** Displays destinations with images, names, and descriptions. Featured destinations use a multi-card carousel.
- **Contact Section:** Users can submit messages (functionality can be built-out with backend integration).
- **FAQ:** Expandable questions using Bootstrap’s Accordion component.

---

## Customization

- Change destination images and text inside the cards in the respective sections.
- Update backgrounds and overlay classes as needed in your CSS.
- To connect forms to a backend, wire up your input fields and form actions to relevant server logic.
